## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project was my final project for my first tech training under Hertechtrail.

## OVERVIEW
The project was built with html,css and javascript.
Check out the project live, recreate if you would love to give yourself a little challenge (for beginners).

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on GitHub. This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, have a read through of this Try Git resource.
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using netlify.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using netflify as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with.

3. Sign up to netlify and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their netlify for GitHub integration.
4. Connect your project to netlify from the "Import project" page, using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
   Once connected, every time you git push, netlify will create a new deployment and the deployment URL will be shown on your Dashboard.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
